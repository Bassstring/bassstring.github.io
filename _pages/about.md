I am currently a [Ph.D. student](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm/people/roeder.html) at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en), working in the [Knowledge Technology Group](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm/) and participating the [IDEAS](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm/about/news/project-ideas.html) and [LeCAREbot](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm/research/project-lecarebot.html) project.
My research interests include cognitive robotics, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.
