I am currently a research associate and Ph.D. student at the
[Hamburg University of Technology](https://www.tuhh.de/), working at the
[Institute for Data Science Foundations](https://www.dsf.tuhh.de).

My research interests are in the domain of cognitive robotics, where I adopt methods of
reinforcement learning and natural language processing.
My work aims to investigate the link of compositionality of language and control for robotic applications,
under the essential consideration of grounded language and embodiment.
